1. **Element-specific discussion**


**5.1 Publication status** <https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/11> [
](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/5)

*Issues to discuss in Karen’s strawman:*

- *Is this a subproperty of any DCMI Term?*
- *Is there a range we can use?*
- *Should we give a few examples in the comment?*

*Also, note that schema.org has "creativeWorkStatus" - "The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, ..." I borrowed "stage" from here because I couldn't think of a good term.*

*Are there any additional publication statuses SRAP might require?* 

*Both COAR Version Types vocabulary and schema.org creativeWorkStatus are limited in the sense that they do not cover what happens to a scholarly work after it is no longer available. Since metadata may (and sometimes must, as in the DOI system) persist after the identified resource is no longer available, we need a set of "post mortem" statuses to inform the users about the reason why the document is gone.* 

*As a COAR Editorial Board member, I have today sent the following draft list of post mortem statuses to the chairs of the board:*

- *RET - retracted*
- *REV - revised*
- *LRU - lost, reason unknown*
- *LPE - lost, the publisher no longer exists*
- *LRE - lost, the institutional repository no longer exists*
- *LCU - lost, a copy is available, but it is unreadable*

*and suggested that the board should discuss this in its next meeting.* 

*Adding these values to the COAR vocabulary may be tricky, not least because these are not version types, unlike other values in the vocabulary. Of course, nothing would prevent COAR from creating a post mortem vocabulary for scholarly resources. I am afraid that in the long term there will be a great demand for such a thing.*

**Summary of discussion:**

Publication status does not have any top level property and is not a sub-property of any existing DC Term

Important to cover situations such as lost and retracted resources

Iterations of a resource map to the idea of the FRBR Expression entity; statuses relate to one expression at a point in time

Date elements cover the time at which a particular event took place, indicating a change of publication status, e.g. date of publication, date accepted or date copyrighted. 

DCMI Terms already exist for some situations: dct:dateAccepted, dct:dateSubmitted, dct:dateCopyrighted

Need for new DC Terms for date types, covering other publication statuses

**Action: Juha to compile list of new date type terms required to cover statuses**

‘Flat’ record structure means that recording dates of all changes of status will read as pertaining to the current expression of the resource, which is incorrect

Date type and publication status must be in agreement; if not, the record is deemed invalid

Date types and values relating to earlier expressions to be recorded as notes and superseded with the current date type/value and status, which pertains to the expression being described. The record for the resource may therefore revolve iteratively with the resource and its expressions

Date type terms are not sub-properties of the related statuses

Date type notes will recommend EDTF format and include examples; conjectural dates may be used

Some publication status values cover one situation only, such as *retracted*, while *lost* may cover a range of scenarios with reasons why a resource has been lost. Multiple values for publication status may therefore be covered by a single date type.

Consider using *missing* rather than *lost* as an electronic resource is unlikely to be completely destroyed with no way of ever retrieving a copy
