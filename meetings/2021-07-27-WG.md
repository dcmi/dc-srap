Embargo

Current proposal to use dct:accessRights for the existence of an embargo, with values from the COAR vocabulary

Further desire to record date of embargo end and length of embargo period 

Proposal of new DCMI Term: dct:embargoDate as a sub-property of dct:dateAvaiable

KC: dct:dateAvailable can cover embrgo end date

JH: embargo date is narrower

AM/SR: use of qualified DC is common institutional practice and varies between institutions

Action: AM to supply Edinburgh University metadata elements used in institutional repository; JH to supply standards used in Finland (National Library?)

Discussion around need for and use cases of embargo date and period, including the suitability of FaBiO’s terms fabio:hasEmbargoDate and fabio:hasEmbargoDuration

SR: is duration useful?

JA: embargo duration used in Onix metadata and by EthOS

JH: suggest allowing a specific date or range of dates

TB: ISO 8601 allows for description of date ranges

KC/SR: embargo dates may be very complex, e.g. archives where end of embargo is time period from death of all persons mentioned in the material – and these people may be alive

Any new DC Term must be developed for broader community use, not just this use case

JH: Record dates as open ended, start/finish for duration (if known) or end date only

Decision: 

dct:accessRights to record presence of embargo, populated by COAR vocabulary

FaBiO terms fabio:hasEmbargoDate and fabio:hasEmbargoDuration are not suitable; need for specifying start and end dates and to cover use cases where only one date may be known

Proposal for a new DCMI Term dct:embargoDate for recording dates and period of embargo in one element

Dates will always be a range and may include conjectural dates, approximates dates, months or days

Dates will be recorded using the ISO 8601 standard

An individual date only is not to be used as this is unclear as to what the date refers to

Embargoes with unknown end dates are recorded as open ended ranges, e.g. 2021-07-21/

Embargo end dates alone are recorded as ‘to date’ ranges, e.g. /2021-07-27

6. Date of next meeting

Tuesday 10th Aug, if sufficient group members are available, or 24th Aug if not
