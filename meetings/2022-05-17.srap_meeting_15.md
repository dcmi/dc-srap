Contributor + MARC Relator codes or role-specific SRAP terms? 

The current SRAP draft has multiple role-specific terms:

- Creator group
- Degree supervisor
- Editor 
- Funder 
- Opponent 

Whenever possible, definitions and URIs of SRAP terms have been taken from MARC relator codes, to indicate semantic equivalence with them (http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/dgs, https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/edt , https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/fnd, http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/opn)

For these terms, would it be better to use just Contributor and subproperty indicating the role the person or group has had? 

This would make it easy to extend SRAP (and DC in general) to all roles MARC relators specify. There are several that are within the SRAP scope, such as honoree (of a festschrift), originator (of scientific ideas), programmer, researcher, research team head, research team member (alas, there is no code for research team).

Then only those contributor roles which are currently not included in MARC relators (such as Creator group) would have to be added SRAP as new DCMI terms (or, alternatively, added to MARC relator codes).
