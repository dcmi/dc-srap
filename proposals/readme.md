* `srapcontrib.csv` implements the [diagram](https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/94#issuecomment-3846733369) provided by Phil, with one exception: the affiliation link goes to the OrganizationContributionShape. That shape and the affiliation shape have the same properties. That may not work, but in the original SRAP model there was one Organization shape that would be used for organizations as contributors and as affiliations.
