5. Element-specific discussion

 a. Publication status https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/11 

    Following the discussion in the 7th meeting, the scope of the Status element was made much narrower and its name was changed to Publication status. 

    OpenAire no longer maintains its vocabulary of publication versions. Instead, it recommends usage of COAR Version types vocabulary (https://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/version_types/). This vocabulary should be the SRAP recommendation as well. 

    From SRAP point of view, this vocabulary covers well the statuses of a living document, but if a publication no longer exists and its metadata record acts as a tombstone, there is no way to indicate in the metadata the reason why the document is no longer available. The following three new statuses have been proposed to the COAR Editorial Board: replaced, retracted and lost.

    If the status is replaced, the record may/should have isVersionOf-link to the updated version. 

    Any other additional publication statuses SRAP might require?

 b. Presented at
 c. Affiliation
 d. DCMI has elements `isVersionOf` and `hasVersion`
   1. Is it necessary to add these to SRAP, and if so, is there anything in SRAP that is different from or adds to dct:isversionof? and/or dct:hasVersion?
