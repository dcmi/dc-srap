# Scholarly Resources Application Profile (SRAP)

This repository is used for the development of the Dublin Core Scholarly
Resources Application Profile (DC-SRAP).

You can find [meeting notes](meetings/) of the Working Group.

The current [draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t8y_3fNrf1rATlYohB6LhPPgr7Ltt3e2/edit) lives in Google Docs; it will eventually be moved into
this repository as Markdown documents.

The issue tracker is used for discussing aspects of the AP, for example
individual elements.
