  dct:description """This book chapter calls for academic libraries to be values-centered, as much as user-centered, when engaging in digital humanities work. Taking as its case study the growth of digital humanities at San Diego State University (SDSU), particularly the DH Center in SDSU Library, this chapter demonstrates how being intentional about the values that guide our work helps build equitable partnerships, meet community needs, manage institutional challenges, engage in critical digital inquiry, and strive toward ethical praxis."""@en ;
