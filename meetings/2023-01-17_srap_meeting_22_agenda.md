4. Draft minutes of previous meeting 

5. Usage of MARC Relator codes 

In the 21st meeting, we decided that MARC Relator codes may be used to indicate the role a person has had in the creation of a scholarly resource. 

We shall not create and maintain a SRAP-specific controlled list of additional codes. However, SRAP documentation needs to explain what kind of roles should be expected. In the current version of the profile, such roles are specified in a separate table. 

Are there existing MARC Relator codes which should or may be added to the profile? 

Are there additional roles which do not have a MARC Relator code yet? If such roles are identified, we need to send a request to DeAnna Evans in the Library of Congress. 

Note: threshold for adding a new relator is low, so it is unlikely that using MARC Relator code list will become a problem. 

6. Accessibility

The WG seems to agree that this element would be useful. 

Description has been modified according to Karen’s suggestion: 

“Textual information describing the accessibility features of a resource, including technical details.

Recommended practice is to define the accessibility options, such as software requirements for using the document or technical features such as open or closed captioning.”

Is the name accessibility suitable, give the broader definition the term has in FAIR principles? What would be the alternative? 

7. Metadata source 

The draft profile currently specifies Metadata source like this: 

Source (database or system) of the metadata record.
Recommended practice is to specify the metadata source by means of its name and/or URI.
SRAP: source (database or system) of the metadata record describing a scholarly resource.
For metadata on scholarly resources, common sources include
- Web of Science (https://clarivate.com/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery/web-of-science/)
- Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/)
- PubMed Central (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)
- ArXiv (https://arxiv.org/)
- Cab Abstracts (https://www.cabi.org/publishing-products/cab-abstracts/)

Since names may change over time, a URI should be used, especially when there is one based on a standard identifier.
Note: Institutional repositories may harvest metadata from external sources. Since the source may have an impact on how the metadata can be reused, it is important to keep track of where the metada-ta came from.

Is this meta-metadata element relevant or out of scope for DCMI in general / SRAP?

If it is relevant, is the definition and other information provided relevant? 

8. Any other business
