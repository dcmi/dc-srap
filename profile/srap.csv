,*Accessibility statement,,xsd:string,,,,"Textual information describing the accessibility features of a resource, including technical details. Recommended practice is to define the accessibility options, such as software requirements for using the document or technical features such as open or closed captioning."
,Bibliographic citation,dct:bibliographicCitation,xsd:string,,,,A bibliographic reference for the resource. Recommended practice is to include sufficient bibliographic detail to identify the resource as unambiguously as possible.
,Contributor,dct:contributor,,Person,,,
,Creator,dct:creator,,Person,,,Name and identifier of persons and/or organizations
,Date,dct:date,xsd:date,,,,Date according to ISO 8601-1
,Date accepted,dct:dateAccepted,xsd:date,,,,Date of acceptance of the resource. Recommended practice is to provide this date if it is specified in the resource. Examples of scholarly resources to which a date of acceptance may be relevant are a thesis (accepted by a university department) or a scientific article (accepted by a journal).
,*Date ahead of print,,xsd:date,,,,"Date when the final version of the resource was made available in the Web or in print format before publication in a journal issue. NOTE Many scientific journals operate article-level publishing, whereby articles are processed for publication immediately following acceptance. Such articles are later compiled into the next journal issue to be published. Recommended practice is to use Date ahead of print to record the date when the article was published, and Date published to record the date when the journal issue was published."
,*Date available as public draft,,xsd:date,,,,Date when an early draft of the resource (predating even preprint) has been made available in an open repository such as ArXiv.
,*Date missing,,xsd:date,,,,"Date when the resource went missing. Recommended practice is to provide this date only if there is no reasonable doubt that the resource is missing; that is, there may be one or more copies left but they cannot be found. Criteria for making the decision that the resource is missing may be developed locally. A SRAP record with date missing should have sufficient metadata to serve as a temporary tombstone of the resource. Date missing may be used when e.g. a printed copy (item) of a resource has disappeared and its current location is unknown for the time being."
,*Date lost,,xsd:date,,,,"Date when the resource was lost. Recommended practice is to provide this date only if there is no reasonable doubt that the resource has been lost; that is, there is not a single (readable) copy of it left. Criteria for making the decision that the resource has been lost may be developed locally, but can include for instance digital documents that can no longer be rendered. A SRAP record with date lost should contain sufficient metadata to serve as a permanent tombstone of the resource. Date lost should be used when e.g. the only known copy of a digital or printed resource has been destroyed or otherwise rendered unusable. Date lost should not be used when a publisher fails but its resources (e.g. serials) are still preserved in a legal deposit collection. Rights metadata should be updated to reflect changes in restrictions on access and use of such archived resources. For serials and other continuing publications, the most convenient solution is to provide this metadata in the host record, from which it may be copied to all component part (article) records."
,Date published,dct:date,xsd:date,,,,Date according to ISO 8601-7
,*Date received as manuscript,,xsd:date,,,,Date when the resource is first received by the publisher. Recommended practice is to provide this data when it is indicated in the resource.

,Date submitted,dct:dateSubmitted,xsd:date,,,,Date according to ISO 8601-10
,*Date submitted as preprint,,xsd:date,,,,"Date when an author submits a preprint of an unpublished resource to a repository. Recommended practice is to provide this information when it is included in the resource, provided by the author or available in the repository application."
,*Date updated,,xsd:date,,,,Date(s) when the publication was republished with additional or revised content. Recommended practice is to provide this date if it is specified in the publication.
,Description,dct:description,xsd:string,,,,Free text; different languages shall be provided separately (as different Description elements)
,*Embargo date range,,xsd:date,,,,"A period of time during which the resource is under embargo. Recommended practice is to describe the date range as recommended for the property Date.

It is also possible to give both the name and the URI."
,*Publication status,,xsd:anyURI,,info:eu-repo/semantics/,IRIstem,"The stage of the resource in the publishing workflow. Recommended practice is to use a publication status value from the following list, ordered according to the increasing level of maturity: / public draft / preprint / postprint / submitted manuscript / publication / updated publication. Recommended practice is use publication status when there are several versions of the same resource, and publication status can be used for telling them apart. Status information should be accompanied with an appropriate date specification whenever such date can be obtained from the resource itself or metadata linked to it.
