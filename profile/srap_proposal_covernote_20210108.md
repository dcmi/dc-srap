Dublin Core is commonly used for description of doctoral dissertations, Master’s theses and other resources institutions of higher education such as universities and polytechnics, for storage and for making them available via their institutional repositories. 

DC Metadata Terms do not contain all core metadata elements required for even a simple description of these materials. Therefore many local extensions to Dublin Core have been created, on national, regional and institutional levels. Two examples of this such specifications which are currently widely used are the metadata specification of the British Library’s EThOS service (https://ethos.bl.uk/) and the Finnish national recommendation for textual resources in institutional repositories (https://www.kiwi.fi/display/Julkaisuarkistopalvelut/Metadatasuositus+julkaisuarkistojen+tekstiaineistolle). 

The Bibliographic Ontology (BIBO, https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/bibo/bibo/) has a broader scope than the aforementioned application profiles, but it has some overlap with aforementioned specifications in the elements level. 

The current situation has led to several negative effects, including: 

- duplicate effort involved with development of multiple models for the same purpose 
- additional development effort needed in tools (cataloguing and search applications, guides)
- reduced semantic interoperability between metadata created with different models 
- diminished usefulness of DC Metadata Terms

In order to make Dublin Core a more valuable tool and to foster usage of Dublin Core for description of scholarly works, the National Library of Finland (NLF) is proposing development of the Scholarly Resources Application Profile (SRAP). A draft of the profile is attached as an annex. 

The adoption of SRAP will not only enable the  extension of DCMI Metadata Terms to take advantage of these  new properties, refine semantics of a number of existing properties,but also reduce the need to develop additional local scholarly works–related DC extensions if SRAP is endorsed by the DCMI Usage Board.

The library nominates the following experts to the working group to be established: 

- Juha Hakala, senior adviser. Juha has worked at the National Library since 1993. He has been involved with Dublin Core since the second DCMI workshop, held in 1996. He has been actively involved in DCMI as a board member. More recently he was the chair of the working group which revised ISO 15836, the ISO version of Dublin Core. He was also the leader of the working group which developed the attached draft SRAP profile. If this proposal is approved, Juha is the NLF candidate for the position of the working group leader. 

- Osma Suominen, information systems specialist. Osma has worked at the National Library since 2013. He holds a doctoral degree in Media Technology from Aalto University, specializing in semantic web technology. He is a member of both the DCMI Governing Board and the Usage Board.
