# Scholarly Resources Application Profile (SRAP)

This repository is used for the development of the Dublin Core Scholarly Resources Application Profile (DC-SRAP).

The current draft specification can be found at [https://dcmi.github.io/dc-srap/](https://dcmi.github.io/dc-srap/), which is automatically published from the source files under [docs](docs).

The SRAP working group has created a [proposal](srap-proposal.md) to the DCMI Usage Board about suggested changes to BIBO and, in some cases, Dublin Core Terms.

You can find [meeting notes](meetings/) of the Working Group.

Issue tracker is used for discussing individual elements and other aspects of the AP.
