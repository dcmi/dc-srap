1. Opening of the meeting 

2. Appointment of the minutes taker (Osma will act as the chair)

3. Approval of the agenda

4. Minutes of the previous meeting (2022-04-05)

See https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/blob/main/meetings/2022-04-05.srap_meeting_12.md

5. SRAP date subproperties

See https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/20

See current definitions in the document https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/blob/main/terms/date_subproperties.md
and in particular Juha’s recent changes based on the discussion in the previous meeting:
https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/compare/bc372ffccf036336210a17ad4fc164a6086456af...8c94f550cff1eee1844021b8f3dd8df2a6597690

Is this good enough for now or do we still need to change the definitions?

6. Affiliation information

See https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/issues/3

There is now an example (by Osma) of expressing affiliation information in XML:
https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/blob/main/profile/affiliation-example.xml

The example relies in part on the idea of using XML attributes to express PIDS in DC, as discussed in the PIDS in DC session in Porto 2018. However, since the element name id is problematic, I've used pid instead.

7. Drafting the SRAP specification in Markdown

This was discussed in the previous meeting and the consensus was that we should start drafting the finished parts of SRAP in Markdown format.

There is already a crude Markdown version of the original SRAP draft specification (2021-01-08): https://github.com/dcmi/dc-srap/blob/main/profile/srap_proposal_20210108.md

8. Any other business

9. Next meeting

Scheduled to take place 2022-04-19, 13:00-14:00 UTC
